#Learning Go
###Trying new things is cool.
The bulk of this repo is random challenges I am trying from this great introductory book: [**golang-book**](http://www.golang-book.com)

ugh make sure:
    `git config --local user.email *email@associatedwithyourgithubaccount.com*`
or github won't give you commit credit
